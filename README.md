# starlight

## run

```
cargo run
```

then type two same-length sequences of `1` and `0`, `start` and `target` (if the sequences are not the same length or your inputs are not parsable to `1` and `0`, the program will panic). The program will return how many switches to activate to go from `start` to `target` considering the starlight game rules.

## test

```
cargo test
```
